ProjectEuler Solutions
============

Before you look at my solutions, I highly recommend you try to solve them on your own.

These are my personal solutions to [these problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) found on [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/). I'm no math whiz so these solutions are by
no means perfect. The vast majority of them were done through some scrappy thinking, or if I got lucky and remembered
some high school math. 

The Java solutions are from when I had just graduated from college.

The Python solutions are from 2023, when I've been a bit bored.
